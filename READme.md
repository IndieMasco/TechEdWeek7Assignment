# Reflection

This week's assignment is all about creating and maintaining apps that submit and retrieve info from a database. This is a fundamental part of web development. So many of the apps and websites we use daily, like Facebook, Instagram, and banking app, are essentially database-driven. It's really made me see how crucial databases are to the tech world.

...

If there is anything you think I could do better or improve on, I'd be happy to listen and learn from what you have to say.

# Requirements

- ✅ 🎯 Create a client using React.

  - This goal has been done through out the client side of my app

- ✅ 🎯 Create multiple pages using React Router.

  - This goal has been done within `App.jsx` and `NavBar.jsx`

- ✅ 🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints.
- ✅ 🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server.

  - Both of these goals have been done within `server.js`.

- ✅ 🎯 Build a React form for users to create posts.

  - This goal has been done within `Form.jsx`.

- ✅ 🎯 Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data.

- I've added images to show this within `./images/Supabase`.

- ✅ 🎯 Display all posts using .map().
- ✅ 🎯 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database.

  - Both of these goals have been done within `Reviews.jsx`

# Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Create dynamic pages using react-router-dom.
- 🏹 Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories
  - For example, /posts/:categoryName.
- 🏹 Allow users to delete posts.
- 🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts.
- 🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts.

# Errors or Bugs I Encountered

- When I originally filled out my form, I only added the POST endpoint for my table, so those responses were being saved, but the game ID was being saved as NULL. I need to fetch the game's ID as well.
