# Reflection

This week's assignment is all about creating and maintaining apps that submit and retrieve info from a database. This is a fundamental part of web development. So many of the apps and websites we use daily, like Facebook, Instagram, and banking app, are essentially database-driven. It's really made me see how crucial databases are to the tech world.

If there is anything you think I could do better or improve on, I'd be happy to listen and learn from what you have to say.
