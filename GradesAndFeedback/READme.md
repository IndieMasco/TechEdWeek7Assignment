# Thank you for submitting this assignment Sam!

You have done a fantastic job applying everything you've learnt this week into this assignment! Showing massive growth and an amazing understanding of how to utilise react to create fully functional full stack SPA that incorporates your postgreSQL database!! The great communication between the different layers of this project is really impressive!

## HTML (JSX)

Your HTML (JSX) is clear and well structured with a good use of semantics. This is an excellent foundation for styling, accessibility and JS interactivity, and makes future changes nice and straightforward! Its easy to lose track of semantics with React so try to keep them in mind.

## CSS

Lovely styling with strong visual hierarchy and responsive behaviour! NOICE! The layout scales gracefully on mobile, your focus states are visible, and colour contrast reads well! It feels polished and user-friendly, with spacing and typography supporting the content really nicely!

Different browsers and operating systems provide different default stylings especially for scroll bars. There are ways to style them to have your own custom scroll bars!

## Javascript and React

Your end-to-end flow is working really well!! Form submission, POST to server, GET to display and DB polling! Phenomenal!! Your useEffect and async/await usage reads clearly to me and the overall structure shows your strong understanding! Your server is set up nicely with multiple GET and POST requests as well as a DELETE end point! It is showing me that you're already several steps closer to mastery!

## Reflection

Thank you for a thoughtful reflection Sam! You’ve identified your successes and challenges clearly and tied them back to this week’s goals, exactly what enables targeted feedback! Keep noting specific errors and fixes, as that speeds up future debugging too!

## Grade

This is an outstanding piece of full-stack work and you should be very proud of yourself! We’re definitely proud of you!! You’ve implemented all of the core goals and pushed into stretch features like dynamic routes and full CRUD capability, all while keeping the app usable and tidy.

I’m giving you an 8/8 overall for this assignment:

Modern development tools: 4, Programming Logic: 4 — because you’ve demonstrated true excellence in structure, responsiveness, deployment, clean routing and database integration. Truly impressive work this week, keep this momentum going!!! Well done!!!
